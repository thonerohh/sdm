  "description": " Scientis, an emerging leader in the science of skin discoloration, announces the launch of Cyspera® Intensive System™, a new three-product system clinically proven to improve hyperpigmentation such as persistent brown patches and dark spots. Sold at hundreds of dermatologist offices nationwide without a prescription, this novel pigment corrector is the next breakthrough in the fight against stubborn hyperpigmentation.\nThe three-product system includes:\nCyspera® Intensive™: features Cysteamine Isobionic-Amid Complex™ that delivers a powerful antioxidant activity to improve the appearance of persistent brown patches and dark spots. This product features a dual chamber technology to keep the cysteamine and AHA separate until skin application. Once applied, the immediate reaction of Isobionic-Amide with AHA leads to instant pigment lightening in the corneal layer.\nCyspera® Neutralize™: features AHA-Amino Acid Complex which neutralizes the smell of cysteamine and re-balances the epidermis before application of Cyspera® Boost™. The L-Arginine Complex stops the Isobionic-Amid Complex™ AHA reaction, and the mild-surfactant gently removes lingering residue, while helping soothe skin and promoting healthy skin barrier. The Lactobionic Acid prepares the skin for Cyspera® Boost™ by neutralizing and balancing the skin's pH.\nCyspera® Boost™: features Isobionic-Amide Complex™ which works synergistically with Cyspera® Intensive™ to even skin tone, improve complexion and deliver a natural and healthy glow. The Isobionic-Amide acts as a multiplier for the efficacy of cysteamine which inhibits multiple steps in the melanogenesis in the skin. The retinol and an anti-oxidative complex provide a visual pigment correction effect by increasing non-pigmented skin layers and shedding. Lastly, the combination of Isobionic-Amide with retinol provides an anti-inflammatory effect to the skin after application of Cyspera® Intensive™.",
