Schema.org provides a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages. The schemas are a set of 'types', each associated with a set of properties. The types are arranged in a hierarchy¹. Here are some commonly used types:

- **Creative works**: CreativeWork, Book, Movie, MusicRecording, Recipe, TVSeries¹
- **Embedded non-text objects**: AudioObject, ImageObject, VideoObject¹

The vocabulary currently consists of:
- **806 Types**
- **1476 Properties**
- **14 Datatypes**
- **90 Enumerations**
- **480 Enumeration members**¹

You can browse the full hierarchy and the full list of types on the official Schema.org website¹. Please note that this information is current as of the time of my last update and may have changed since then. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to the official Schema.org documentation¹.
